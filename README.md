# Uncommon React Native Bug: Accessing State Before Initialization

This repository demonstrates a common but often overlooked error in React Native: attempting to access a state variable before it has been initialized using the `useEffect` hook.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

## Bug Description

The bug occurs when a component tries to access a state variable declared with `useState` inside a `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array (`[]`). This empty array causes the `useEffect` to execute only once, after the component renders.  However, at this point, `useState` hasn't fully initialized its state, potentially leading to an error or unexpected results.

## Solution

The solution is to ensure the `useEffect` hook doesn't try to access the state until it's been properly initialized. A common approach is to check if the state is `undefined` before accessing it.  Alternatively, conditionally rendering the parts that use the state until it's available.
