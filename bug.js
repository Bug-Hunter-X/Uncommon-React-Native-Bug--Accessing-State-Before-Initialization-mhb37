This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This often happens when using `useState` hook before the component has fully mounted. Consider this example:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Count:', count); // Accessing count before initialization
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

In this scenario, the `useEffect` hook runs immediately after the component renders, which is *before* `useState` has had a chance to populate the `count` variable. Attempting to log `count` at this point will result in `undefined`.
