Here's a corrected version that avoids the error:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Check if the state is initialized before accessing
    if (count !== undefined) {
      console.log('Count:', count);
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

This improved code checks if `count` is `undefined` before accessing it, preventing the error.  Another approach is to use the state's initial value or to render a loading indicator until the state is ready.  This will improve the user experience and prevent unexpected behavior.
